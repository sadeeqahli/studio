i want replit handle and applying my payment method (integration) in my football booking application that am building inside replit  were by I’ll be providing the necessary things here is how I want the replit app to use Flutterwave as the payment integration to be Am going to use Flutterwave for all the gateway transactions in the application for secured payment and generating a unique platform for virtual wallet for every new user and pitch owners so that when transactions is being taken it I’ll reflect on everyone wallet I want the Flutterwave to be a place for all transactions in my app that’s why I want to integrate Flutterwave. base on my description, and how my app is.For me as the admin that I build a web app which there is payment integration in it like a player transfer money to platform virtual account for pitch owners. And a pitch owner which is a user itself that uploads pitches that my platform give him a virtual account that he would be seeing all payment and then later he can withdraw And then I want a process of split payment were by if a player pays money it split and credit both owners and admin of the platform base on our agreement of a booking commission were by the more will be deducted How can I use Flutterwave for all that creating a owners virtual account were money will be reflecting and then split  I then come up with an idea we’re i want to add a cashback reward for every payment that a user makes using my own profit (commissions fee)per booking that is made let say like rewarding with 30 naira to make the user feel good and uses my platform and then I want to add a referral fee for let say a user invite 10 active user and then the 10 of them uses my app and make payment booking a pitch I’ll reward him 5000 naira all these rewarding that am doing is for the user when booking he can use the bonuses and have a discount to book another pitch. I want it that if a player make a payment and then money get splitted to owners and admin I want it that before the admin get credit I want another split from the admin commission to created, the particular player that make the payment get it’s cash back instantly And then I want it to becoming soon on the user side And here is the subscription plan for the owners I want take a look out to my community given them a free 90 days free trial before charging them with the subscription plan since I’ve 3 plans which is the starter plan that am charging 10% of booking commission and then providing a standard support, 2 listing pitch maximum, not given other available service, I then make and the plus plan which is the most popular one charging 20,000 a month and 5% booking commission, 5 listing pitch maximum, 24/7 platform support, given some available services and I then making it coming soon and then here it come the pro plan were we charge 40,000 a month and 3% commission of the booking fee it come with full time platform support, unlimited listing of pitch, dedicated 24/7 support, advanced analytics & report, availability of services and so much more I then make it coming soon too making only the starter available so now i then want the starter to free for only 90 days not collecting any booking commission till after the finish the trials.So now I then come up with looking at my community to make things more easy and to campaign for my platform to get more pitch owners to register with us and list their pitch and then I want to reduce the start commission to 5% and the pro plan to 3% and then the pro plus plan to 1.5% of booking commission to attract more onwers to register with me and making the first 90 days free trial, so as to to defeat the upcoming competitors and then For the businesses that are not serious and have no intention of ever paying Instead of a blanket 3-month trial for everyone, forever, use it as a powerful launch strategy.Offer: A limited-time "Founding Members" deal. * The Deal: "Be one of the first 50 pitch owners in [Your City/Kano] to sign up and get a 90-day FREE trial of our Plus Plan. No commitment, no credit card required." * Why this works:   * Urgency & Exclusivity: The "first 50" creates scarcity and encourages immediate action. People want to be part of an exclusive club.   * Manages Your Risk: You control your costs by limiting the number of extended free trials.   * Builds a Core Group: These first 50 members become your evangelists, your case studies, and your feedback group. You can work closely with them to perfect the app.   * Sets the Standard: After the first 50 slots are filled, you can revert to the standard (and still very generous) 40-day free trial for all new sign-ups.Verdict: Yes, use a 3-month free trial, but frame it as an exclusive, limited-time launch offer to create urgency and capture the most influential pitch owners first.
