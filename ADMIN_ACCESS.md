# How to Access the Admin Dashboard

To access the admin dashboard for your deployed application, follow these steps:

1.  Navigate to the `/admin/login` URL of your application. For example, if your application is deployed at `https://myapp.com`, you would go to `https://myapp.com/admin/login`.

2.  Use the following hardcoded credentials to log in:
    *   **Email:** `admin@naijapitchconnect.com`
    *   **Password:** `admin123`

**Important Security Note:**

These credentials are hardcoded into the application for demonstration and prototyping purposes only. For a production environment, it is strongly recommended to replace this with a secure authentication system (like Firebase Authentication with custom claims for admin roles) to ensure that only authorized personnel can access the admin dashboard.
